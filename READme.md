# 🧠 C Algorithms

Welcome to my collection of algorithm implementations in **C**. This project is intended to improve my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures by building them from scratch.

## 📂 Structure

Each file in this repo contains a self-contained algorithm or data structure written in C.

Example layout:


## 🛠️ What’s Inside

- 🔢 Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
- 🔍 Searching Algorithms (Binary, Linear)
- 📚 Data Structures (Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc.)
- 📏 Time and Space Complexity notes
- 📄 Well-commented C code for learning

## ✅ Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g. `gcc`)
- Basic knowledge of compiling C code

Example to compile:
```bash
gcc sorting/bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
./bubble_sort
